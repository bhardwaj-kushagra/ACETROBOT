ACETROBOT is an innovative project combining OpenCV-based object tracking and following functionalities with a pan-tilt mechanism driven by servo motors, all powered by a Raspberry Pi. Employing the HaarCascades face tracking model, ACETROBOT can accurately track objects within its field of view. Its versatile design includes a 4-wheeler chassis, ultrasonic sensor, and L298N motor drivers, enabling smooth object following using DC motors. Equipped with a Raspberry Pi camera for video processing, ACETROBOT showcases the fusion of hardware and software technologies to create a sophisticated autonomous system capable of precise object tracking and following in real-time.
